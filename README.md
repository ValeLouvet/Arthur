Test for Arthur
- First API endpoint “GET /prime” will return a “Content-Type: application/json” in any JSON
schema you like. This endpoint should calculate prime numbers from 1 to 10,000 (inclusive).
- Second API endpoint “GET /even” will return a “Content-Type: application/json” in any JSON
schema you like. This endpoint should calculate the sum of the even numbers from 1 to 10,000
(inclusive).
- webpage under “GET /stats” should show “Daily Average Request Time Details” grouped by
Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) from current UTC date to -1 year for “/prime” endpoint and “/even”
endpoint. If 0 requests made for a particular day, show “N/A”. Current UTC date should not show
since is “Average time per day”, stats only show data from -1 day to -1 year. Any Quarter should
show a Summary Data as shown in the picture below.
Notes:
- Daily average Request Time in ms format. As an example, 1,5 s becomes 1500 ms.
- WebPage can be generated by Blade or another template system or even better, dynamic by
using any Javascript framework you like that collects the data from another endpoint. As a bonus,
the endpoint containing the data can be cached for -1 day
- Store data in SQLite file, using only the strictly necessary data. Summary data can be calculated
on the webpage itself using blade, other template system or JavaScript.
